# Expense Tracker

Allows users around the world to sign up and log in where ever they are at. The Map app will then display a pin drop at their current location. Once logged in, the user can chat with other users of the app. All chat rooms are saved in the db so users can log out, log back in and continue conversation where they left from. Written in Vue.js, uses Firebase for database purposes, User Authorization and deployment.

## Summary

I began participating in a 'Software Development Mastermind' mentorship program towards the end of 2019. The purpose of the program is to strengthen and expand my skills as a Full Stack developer. The completed work is showcased on my GitHub and portfolio/personal website.

This World Wide Programmers app was a side project I completed while studying Vue and Firebase.

My ultimate goal is to land a job that incorporates my skills and utilizes my abilities and outgoing personality. So if you enjoyed reviewing my code as much as I did writing it, please find me on one of the links provided below.
